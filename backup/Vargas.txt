The Vargas deal isn't atrocious, but he's getting paid more like an average pitcher than a below average one, which he is.
I don't think the Royals realize they just committed themselves to four years of Jason Vargas. He of a career 4.30 ERA, 630 Ks in 979 IP.

Vargas move may not end up bad, but its not major. #5 cussing out lame autograph seeker is more entertaining.
I don't understand the Vargas signing.  He's a below average pitcher.  He won't help the Royals win the division.  And four years?!!

For 3 of the last 4 years, Jason Vargas' home ERA was more than one full run lower than his road ERA -- Safeco and Angel Stadium #RoyalOops?
32MM for 4 yrs is reasonable for Vargas. Before the blood clot limited IP in '13, 192.2, 201, &amp; 217.1 IP in 2010, 2011 &amp; 2012. #Royals
@Royals just picked up Jason Vargas. Is this the big baseball related news I've been waiting for? I'm not mad. But I'm not glad. #weneedabat
@vargas_adam lmfao you  should see if its true with one of your bitches lol
@jazayerli "Vargas, whose fastball averages about 88 mph, should benefit from the Royals' strong defense as well as Kauffman Stadium"
@TheKCShow_17 @dabutlerdidit13 wouldn't put it passed Dayton to do nothing I want Hughes instead of Vargas
Get that someone for me please. I want to see my self "fucked up"üíï
Man, Vargas is just so meh. $32 million isnt bad in a vacuum, but given the Royals financial restraints, it will limit. Four years is insane
For people so against the Vargas deal: What *should* they have done instead?

#Royals must be desperate for attention if they think a "major" announcement involves Jason Vargas. #frustration

So the rotation next year will be: Shields, Vargas, Guthrie, Duffy, Ventura?
